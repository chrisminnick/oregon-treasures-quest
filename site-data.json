        "description": "Dubbed the \"Birthplace of American Sport Climbing,\" Smith Rock State Park in Deschutes County boasts the first climb in America that established the 5.14 grade—one of the most technically-difficult ratings in the sport. Famed climber Alan Watts was key to putting this spectacular spot to \"hang\" out on the map in the 1980s, as he elevated Smith Rock's incredible crags and cracks to new heights. Today, the park has thousands of climbing routes on walls like Monkey Face, Morning Glory, and The Marsupials, as well as many miles of hiking and mountain biking trails. And, to top it off, the Crooked River runs through the middle of the park, making it a picturesque, \"pitch\" perfect paradise in Central Oregon's High Desert.",

Because of its barren, wide-open nature, the desert is a favorite spot to go land sailing in the dry season, or you can camp beneath the starry skies in one of the quietest, most secluded spots in Oregon. The beautiful Alvord Desert is extremely remote—please check the weather report and the Bureau of Land Management website for any weather alerts or cautions regarding visiting, and pack extra water, fuel, and essentials if you make the journey.",

Buried within the Siskiyou Mountains in Josephine County you'll find The Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve—a labyrinth of bends, twists, and treasures that will truly allow you to explore a mountain from the inside and out. A hunter named Elijah Davidson came across the cave in 1874 while chasing after his dog who went in after a bear, and the cave went on to become the state's first national monument in 1909. Visit the \"Marble Halls of Oregon\" for yourself to see the colorful rocks of the cave that appear painted from the eons of acidic water that seeped into them. Tip: if you are super adventurous, check out the \"Off Trail Caving Tour\" opportunity and be sure to schedule ahead to secure your tour slot.",

        "description": "Explore the Beaver State's past and future in Marion County with a visit to the Oregon State Capitol building in Salem, Oregon's capital city. It is one of only three state capitols built in the Art Deco architectural style and is topped with the Oregon Pioneer—a 22 foot tall bronze sculpture of a golden woodsman. Guided tours are available, including a tour of the tower which offers a 360-degree view of the City of Salem and surrounding Willamette Valley. Hint: try to time your visit to go in the spring, because the cherry blossoms blooming around the Capitol are a feast for the senses.",

It was once home to a prehistoric winter village of the Sahaptin peoples of the Columbian Plateau, and the spot also set the scene for a railroad war in the early 1900s. Here, two tycoons battled to be the first to reach Bend, and the road to reach Macks Canyon is what remains of the losing line.

The lake was formed by glacial events that began millions of years ago, and rests beneath the often snowcapped, 10,000 foot peaks of the Wallowa Mountains. You can camp at the park, enjoy paddling or boating on the lake, or take a nearby trail into the majestic Eagle Cap Wilderness that is filled with several smaller, sparkling lakes. For a special treat, take the Wallowa Lake Tramway's Swiss-made gondola to the top of Mt. Howard for a heavenly view.",

Once dubbed the \"Wool Capital of the World,\" today only a few dozen people still live in the town, which has one hotel and a few local businesses that mostly operate in the spring and summer. But while Shaniko sits off the beaten path, the city is filled with history and charm that immerses visitors in the Old West. So, grab your camera and snap some pictures of wooden sidewalks and the old city hall that houses a jail, a school, and a post office. And if you're there in August, check out \"Shaniko Days\"—the annual festival that brings out hundreds of folks to celebrate this special slice of Oregon history.",

And hidden among the stunning tapestry of colors lies a world class record of plant and animal evolution, with some leaf fossils dating back 40 million years.
